  heroStoryText: "Gabriela Silang (1731\u20131763)\r\n\"The Warrior Widow of the
    Ilocos\"\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\nGabriela Silang was the first Filipina to lead a
    rebellion against colonial Spain. After the death of her husband Diego Silang,
    she assumed command of the resistance, proving herself as a formidable military
    leader in a male-dominated society and era.\r\n\r\n\U0001F467 Early Life and
    Background\r\nBorn Maria Josefa Gabriela Cari\xF1o Silang in Sarrat, Ilocos Norte,
    in 1731, she was of mixed Ilocano and Spanish ancestry. Orphaned early, she was
    adopted by a priest and received a basic education\u2014an unusual privilege
    for women of her time.\r\n\r\n\U0001F48D Marriage to Diego Silang\r\nGabriela
    married Diego Silang in 1757. Diego was a revolutionary leader who opposed the
    abuses of the Spanish clergy and collaborated briefly with the British during
    their occupation of Manila (1762\u20131764). The couple became symbols of the
    Ilocano resistance.\r\n\r\n\u2694\uFE0F Rise as a Military Leader\r\nOn May 28,
    1763, Diego was assassinated by his own allies, bribed by Spanish authorities.
    Rather than surrender, Gabriela took up leadership. She rallied Diego\u2019s
    troops and retreated into the Cordilleras. For four months, she led raids and
    built alliances with indigenous peoples like the Tingguian.\r\nShe commanded
    up to 2,000 fighters in what became one of the most significant revolts in Northern
    Luzon.\r\n\r\n\U0001F480 Capture and Execution\r\nGabriela was betrayed and captured
    in Abra. On September 20, 1763, she and her followers were executed by hanging
    in Vigan. She met death with dignity, becoming a martyr for both national and
    women\u2019s liberation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\U0001F33A Legacy\r\nGabriela is commemorated
    in monuments and through the women\u2019s rights organization GABRIELA, which
    fights for social justice and gender equality. Her story is taught in schools
    as a symbol of female empowerment and patriotism.\r\n"
