  heroStoryText: " Lapu-Lapu (c. 1491 \u2013 c. 1542) \n\n\"The First Defender of
    Philippine Freedom\"\n\n  Overview: Datu Lapu-Lapu was the chieftain of Mactan
    who defeated Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. He is regarded as
    the first Filipino hero to resist foreign colonization. \n\nPre-Colonial Leadership
    Born around 1491, Lapu-Lapu ruled Mactan Island in what is now Cebu. As a datu,
    he governed an independent barangay that was part of a decentralized political
    system common in the archipelago before colonization.\n\nArrival of the Spaniards
    On April 27, 1521, Ferdinand Magellan landed in Cebu under orders from Spain
    to convert native leaders to Christianity and subjugate the islands. Rajah Humabon
    of Cebu converted and allied with Magellan. But Lapu-Lapu refused to surrender
    sovereignty.  \u2694\uFE0F Battle of Mactan When Magellan attempted to coerce
    Lapu-Lapu into submission, he and about 60 men attacked Mactan. Lapu-Lapu and
    over a thousand warriors defended their island fiercely. Magellan was killed
    in battle, marking the first documented defeat of European colonizers in Asia. 
    \U0001F4DC Historical Uncertainty While exact details about Lapu-Lapu\u2019s
    death are unknown, local legends claim he lived to old age and was never captured
    by the Spaniards. Others say his body turned into stone and still guards Mactan\u2019s
    shores.  \U0001F3DB\uFE0F Legacy Lapu-Lapu\u2019s courage is immortalized in
    the Mactan Shrine and statues across the Philippines. "
