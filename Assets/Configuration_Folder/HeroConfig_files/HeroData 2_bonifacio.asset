  heroStoryText: "Andr\xE9s Bonifacio (1863\u20131897)\r\n\"Father of the Philippine
    Revolution\"\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\nAndr\xE9s Bonifacio founded the Katipunan and
    was the first to call for full independence from Spain through armed revolution.
    Known as the \u201CSupremo,\u201D he rallied the working class and led the first
    major revolutionary acts.\r\n\r\n\U0001F466 Humble Origins\r\nBorn on November
    30, 1863, in Tondo, Bonifacio was the eldest of six children. Orphaned young,
    he supported his siblings by selling paper fans and canes. Though he had little
    formal schooling, he educated himself through books on politics, history, and
    law.\r\n\n\uFFFD Katipunan and the Revolution\r\nIn 1892, Bonifacio founded the
    Kataas-taasan, Kagalang-galangang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan (KKK), which
    grew into a mass movement. By 1896, it had over 100,000 members. Bonifacio led
    the Cry of Balintawak, tearing his cedula as a symbol of revolt.\r\n\r\n\u2694\uFE0F
    Revolutionary Campaigns and Power Struggle\r\nBonifacio led early uprisings in
    Manila and surrounding provinces. Internal conflicts with Aguinaldo\u2019s faction
    culminated in the Tejeros Convention, where Bonifacio lost leadership. He disputed
    the results, declaring the election void.\r\n\r\n\U0001F6AB Arrest and Execution\r\nIn
    1897, Bonifacio was arrested, tried for treason by Aguinaldo\u2019s camp, and
    executed in the mountains of Maragondon, Cavite on May 10\u2014an act still debated
    today.\r\n\r\n\U0001F525 Legacy\r\nBonifacio remains a revered figure and a symbol
    of the Filipino masses. His birthdate, November 30, is celebrated as Bonifacio
    Day. His bravery underscores that independence is often won by the courage of
    ordinary people.\r\n"
