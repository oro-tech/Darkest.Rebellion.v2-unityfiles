  description: "Andres Bonifacio, known as the \u201CFather of the Philippine Revolution,\u201D
    often wore a red bandana tied around his head. The color red symbolized courage,
    sacrifice, and readiness for battle. While many artistic depictions show him
    wearing a barong Tagalog, eyewitnesses and Katipunan memoirs suggest he commonly
    dressed as a working-class Filipino\u2014camisa de chino, rolled-up sleeves,
    and a red bandana, which became a symbol of Katipunan defiance."
