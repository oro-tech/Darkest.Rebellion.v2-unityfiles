  description: "These books directly challenged the Spanish colonial system and the
    friarocracy. Noli Me T\xE1ngere means \u201CTouch Me Not\u201D\u2014a warning
    about the \u201Ccancer\u201D of colonial oppression. El Filibusterismo (\u201CThe
    Reign of Greed\u201D) was a darker sequel calling for societal change. These
    books awakened Filipino nationalism and became the literary foundation of the
    1896 Philippine Revolution. Because of these works, Rizal was banned, persecuted,
    exiled to Dapitan, and eventually executed."
